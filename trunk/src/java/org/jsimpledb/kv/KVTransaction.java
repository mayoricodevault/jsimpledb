/**
 * {@link KVDatabase} transaction API.
 *
 * <p>
 * Provides a transactional view into a {@link KVStore}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances may throw {@link KVTransactionException} during any operation if the transaction cannot be continued.
 * In particular, {@link StaleTransactionException} is thrown by a transaction that is no longer open, and
 * {@link RetryTransactionException} is thrown when the transaction should be retried due to a transient
 * problem (such as a write conflict with another transaction). When {@link RetryTransactionException} is thrown by
 * {@link #commit}, the transaction may have actually been committed. Therefore, transactions should be written to be idempotent.
 * When any {@link KVTransactionException} is thrown, the transaction must still support invoking {@link #rollback},
 * but all other operations may throw {@link StaleTransactionException}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an instance throws a {@link KVTransactionException}, the transaction should be implicitly rolled back.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations must throw {@link StaleTransactionException} if {@link #commit} or {@link #rollback} has already
 * been invoked, or if the {@link KVTransaction} instance is no longer usable for some other reason. In particular,
 * implementations should throw {@link TransactionTimeoutException} if an operation is attempted on a transaction
 * that has been held open past some maximum allowed time limit.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations are responsible for ensuring modifications to {@code byte[]} arrays after method
 * invocations do no harm. This usually means {@code byte[]} array parameters and return values must be copied.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Accessing keys that start with {@code 0xff} is not supported and will result in {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 * </p>
