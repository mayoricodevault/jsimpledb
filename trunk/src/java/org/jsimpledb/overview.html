<p>
This is the API documentation for version @VERSION@ (r@SVN_REVISION@) of the <a href="http://jsimpledb.googlecode.com/"><b>JSimpleDB</b></a>
Java library.
</p>

<p>
JSimpleDB is designed to make powerful persistence easy for Java
programmers. It does this by relegating the database to the simplest
role possible - storing data as key/value pairs - and reimplementing
and enhancing all of the usual database supporting features, such
as indexes and notifications, in a Java-centric way. JSimpleDB also
adds a few new features that traditional databases don't provide.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Designed from the ground up to be Java-centric; completely type-safe.</li>
    <li>Scales gracefully to large data sets</li>
    <li>Configured entirely via Java annotations (of which there are only 12)</li>
    <li>Regular Java objects and queries - no special &quot;query language&quot; needed</li>
    <li>Powerful event notification system</li>
    <li>Support for rolling schema changes across multiple nodes with no downtime</li>
    <li>Support for indexed fields and user-defined custom types</li>
    <li>Works on top of any database that can function as a key/value store (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)</li>
    <li>Extensible command line interface (CLI) supporting arbitrary Java expressions</li>
    <li>Built-in graphical user interface (GUI) based on Vaadin</li>
</ul>
