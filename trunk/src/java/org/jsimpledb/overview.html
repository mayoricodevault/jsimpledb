<p>
This is the API documentation for version @VERSION@ of the <a href="http://jsimpledb.googlecode.com/"><b>JSimpleDB</b></a>
Java library.
</p>

<p>
JSimpleDB makes powerful persistence simple for Java programmers.
</p>

<p>
JSimpleDB's goal is to make Java persistence as simple as possible, doing so in a
Java-centric manner, while remaining strictly type safe.
</p>

<p>
JSimpleDB does this without sacrificing flexibility or scalability by relegating
the database to the simplest role possible - storing data as key/value pairs -
and providing all other supporting features, such as indexes, command line
interface, etc., in a simpler, type-safe, Java-centric way.
</p>

<p>
JSimpleDB also adds important new features that traditional databases don't provide.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Designed from the ground up to be Java-centric; completely type-safe.</li>
    <li>Works on top of any database that can function as a key/value store (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)</li>
    <li>Scales gracefully to large data sets; no "whole database" operation is ever required</li>
    <li>Configured entirely via Java annotations (only one is required)</li>
    <li>Queries are regular Java code - there is no "query language" needed</li>
    <li>Change notifications from arbitrarily distant objects</li>
    <li>Built-in support for rolling schema changes across multiple nodes with no downtime</li>
    <li>Supports simple and composite indexes and user-defined custom types</li>
    <li>Extensible command line interface (CLI) supporting arbitrary Java queries</li>
    <li>Built-in Java-aware graphical user interface (GUI) based on Vaadin </li>
</ul>
